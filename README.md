# Connecticut Plus

Connecticut Plus is a companion app to [Connecticut](https://yashrajnayak.github.io/connecticut/), designed to compare snapshots of GitHub user connections over time.

## Overview

Connecticut Plus allows you to visualize the growth in connections between GitHub users by comparing two snapshots taken from the Connecticut app. It provides insights into how developer networks evolve during meetups or over specific periods.

## Features
